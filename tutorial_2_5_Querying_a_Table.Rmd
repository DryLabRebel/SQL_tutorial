2.5 Querying a Table
--------------------

SELECT -- Is the SQL query command, extremely important, flagship command.

The `*` is shorthand for 'all'. So,

```{sql}

SELECT * FROM weather;

```

Will select all columns from weather.

```{sql}

SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date FROM weather;

```

Will also select all columns from weather.

table weather;

As I have surmised will also select all columns from weather. Dangerous if you're working with large datasets.

```{sql}

SELECT -- can also take expressions.

```

```{sql}

SELECT city, (temp_lo+temp_hi)/2 AS temp_avg, date FROM weather;

```

*Note: it keeps a record of my command history, even after I close the session, and log back in!*

```{sql}

SELECT * FROM weather
	ORDER BY city;

```

```{sql}

SELECT * FROM weather
	ORDER BY city, temp_lo;

```

Will do exactly what it sounds like it will do.

```{sql}

SELECT DISTINCT city
	FROM weather;

```

Will select unique entries from the city column, but the order may be unreliable. use:

```{sql}

SELECT DISTINCT city
	FROM weather
	ORDER BY city;

```

For more predictable results.

3.6 Inheritance
---------------

*This is the creative, but inefficient way*

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE capitals (
  name	      text,
  population  real,
  altitude    int,	-- feet
  state	      char(2)
);

CREATE TABLE non_capitals (
  name	      text,
  population  real,
  altitude    int,	-- feet
);

CREATE VIEW cities AS
  SELECT name, population, altitude FROM capitals
    UNION
  SELECT name, population, altitude FROM non_capitals;

```

However, this requires a lot of work when it comes to updating several rows at once, among other things.

*This is a better way*

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE cities (
  name	      text,
  populations real,
  altitude    int     -- feet
);

CREATE TABLE capitals (
  state char(2)
) INHERITS (cities);

SELECT name, altitude
  FROM cities
  WHERE altitude > 500;

SELECT name, altitude
  FROM ONLY cities
  WHERE altitude > 500;

```

Inheritance is a powerful tool, but has not yet been integrated with other SQL functions, such as unique contraints and foreign keys.

See [here](file:///usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/12.1/share/doc/postgresql/html/ddl-inherit.html) for more detail on inheritance.

2.6 Joins
---------

This will join two tables together, and will select all columns in cases where 'city' from 'weather', matches 'name' from 'cities' table (try not to get confused about that).

```{sql}

SELECT *                                           
	FROM weather, cities
	WHERE city = name;

```

However, this will truncate the table taking only matching rows.
Furthermore this will show all available columns, including matching columns.
This:

```{sql}

SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
	FROM weather, cities
	WHERE city = name;

```

Will only show the columns you want.

Also, I found a typo in one of my names 'San Fransisco'... so I  figured out how to change it:

```{sql}

UPDATE weather
	SET city = REPLACE(city, 'Fransisco', 'Francisco')
	WHERE city LIKE ('%Fransisco');

```

*Noice*

-

Note, in the SELECT command above, it works because all columns in both tables have unique names.

If there are columns with the same name in both tables, you need to specify those columns specifically.

```{sql}

SELECT weather.city, weather.temp_lo, cities.location
	FROM weather, cities
	WHERE city = name;

```

etc.

***Best practise***: Always qualify each row name with the corresponding table (as above), in a join, unless you have a reason not to, incase duplicates arise at a later date.

Note: Rmarkdown supports heaps of languages!! Including SQL

[//]: # ( No syntax highlighting for sql code? )

Joining tables can also be expressed in this form:

```{sql}

SELECT *
    FROM weather INNER JOIN cities ON (weather.city = cities.name);

```

If you want to keep the extra rows from weather:

```{sql}

SELECT *
    FROM weather LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON (weather.city = cities.name);

```

```{sql}

SELECT 
    W1.city,  -- Take 'city' from W1 (which doesn't exist yet?
    W1.temp_lo AS low,	-- Take 'temp_lo' from W1 and label it 'low'
    W1.temp_hi AS high,	-- Take 'temp_hi' from W1 and label it 'high'
    W2.city,  -- Take 'city' from W1 (which doesn't exist yet?
    W2.temp_lo AS low,	-- Take 'temp_lo' from W2 and label it 'low'
    W2.temp_hi AS high	-- Take 'temp_hi' from W2 and label it 'high'
    FROM weather W1, weather W2	-- *Does this 'create' W1 and W2?* It would appear so
    WHERE W1.temp_lo < W2.temp_lo
    AND W1.temp_hi > W2.temp_hi;

```

So it also appears that the interpreter accepts the statement as a block, parses it, and executes the relevant code in the correct sequence

This kind of abbreviating is apparently common, so keep an eye out for it.

another example:


```{sql}

SELECT *
    FROM weather w, cities c
    WHERE w.city = c.name;

```

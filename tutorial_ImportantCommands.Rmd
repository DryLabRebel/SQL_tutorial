Important SQL Clauses
---------------------

```{sql}

SELECT
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
ORDER BY
HAVING
LIKE
UPDATE
DELETE

BEGIN
COMMIT
SAVEPOINT
ROLLBACK

OVER
PARTITION BY

-- What's the difference between syntax highlighting? What groups them together?


-- Aggregate functions

min()
max()
sum()
avg()
rank()

```

`WHERE` selects input rows before groups and aggregates are computed (thus, it controls which rows go into the aggregate computation), 
whereas `HAVING` selects group rows after groups and aggregates are computed.

Is it bad practise to simply use `table weather;` to view a table, instead of `SELECT * FROM weather;`

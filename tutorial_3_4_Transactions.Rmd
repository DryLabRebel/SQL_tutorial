3.4 Transactions
----------------

A *fundamental* concept... bundling multiple steps into a single 'all-or-nothing' operation

If you want make updates to, for example, banking transactions, you absolutely do not want to be in a situation where one part of the transaction suceeds (maybe a debit to one account), and another part fails (the credit to the corresponding account) which would leave the system in disequilibrium, and the customers would not be happy.

It's easy to see why it's important that these operations perform as an 'all-or-nothing' scenario. You need a computationally guaranteed way of achieving this.

A transaction is set up by wrapping the block in `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` commands.

```{sql}

BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Alice';
UPDATE branches SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice');
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Bob';
UPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Bob');
COMMIT;

```

If partwat through a transaction, a problem occurs, the 'ROLLBACK' command will end the transaction, as if nothing happened.

Note: PostGreSQL implicitly treats all statements as transactions.

Furthermore, transaction blocks can be further micromanaged using *savepoints*.

```{sql}

BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Alice';
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Bob';
-- wait that's not right, it's supposed to be Wayne!
ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Wayne';
COMMIT;

```

Note: the table 'accounts' doesn't exist in mydb, these are just examples taken from the tutorial pages.

3.2 Views
---------

So a view, is kind of like an object. You can create a 'view', which seems to be basically a shortcut for some query you have used previously.

```{sql}

CREATE VIEW myview AS
    SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
	FROM weather, cities
	WHERE city = name;

```

Here I've stored the query (beginning with 'SELECT') inside the 'view' named 'myview'

But a 'view' is not simply a window, because it can be embedded inside another view, implying that it can be operated on?

Using views often is good database design and practise

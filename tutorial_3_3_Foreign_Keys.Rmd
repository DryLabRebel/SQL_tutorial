3.3 Foreign Keys
----------------

Only the most basic introduction here, but considered extremely important to high quality database management

They basically provide a hard link between two tables, such that one cannot insert values in one that do not match another.

```{sql}

-- The new declaration of the tables would look like this:

CREATE TABLE cities (
        city     varchar(80) primary key,
        location point
);

CREATE TABLE weather (
        city      varchar(80) references cities(city),
        temp_lo   int,
        temp_hi   int,
        prcp      real,
        date      date
);

-- Now try inserting an invalid record:

INSERT INTO weather VALUES ('Berkeley', 45, 53, 0.0, '1994-11-28');
-- ERROR:  insert or update on table "weather" violates foreign key constraint "weather_city_fkey"
-- DETAIL:  Key (city)=(Berkeley) is not present in table "cities".

```

How then, do you insert a row that doesn't violate this? Insert into both tables at the same time?

How?

Note: Take a look at Chapter 5!!

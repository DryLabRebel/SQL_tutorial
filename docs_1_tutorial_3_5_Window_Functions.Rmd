3.5 Window Functions
--------------------

Window functions work similar to aggregate functions, except that it retains the individual rows. You can perform operations on sets of rows and apply the result to each row individually.

```{sql}

SELECT depname, empno, salary, avg(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY depname)  FROM empsalary;

```

Note: the table 'empsalary' doesn't exist in mydb, these are just examples taken from the tutorial pages.

More details about window functions can be found in Section 4.2.8, Section 9.21, Section 7.2.5, and the SELECT reference page.

The key here in this statement is the `OVER` clause. This prompts the statement to be treated as a window function, instead of an aggregate function.

the `OVER` clause always follows the aggregate command, and is followed by the directive, i.e. the conditions for the processing of the aggregate function.

```{sql}

SELECT depnam, empno, salary,
    rank() OVER (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM empsalary;

```

The rest of the stuff in this tutorial seems pretty abstract. Hard to really conceptualize without a dataset. So I'd have to either create a dataset the same as the examples used, or one similar.

How to add a lot of rows quickly?
  - What about that stuff before about sym linking tables?
  - Can I just start my own database project and go from there?

Maybe I should work my way through this tutorial as best I can, then start my project afterwards, and come back to these sections as needed.

I just need to remember that 'window functions' are operations on a set of related rows, as designated by the `OVER` () Clause

> Window functions are permitted only in the `SELECT` list and the `ORDER BY` clause of the query. They are forbidden elsewhere, such as in `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` and `WHERE` clauses. This is because they logically execute after the processing of those clauses. Also, window functions execute after non-window aggregate functions. This means it is valid to include an aggregate function call in the arguments of a window function, but not vice versa.

Always remember that you can use a sub-select to perform operations inside `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` and `WHERE` clauses.
